# Training our own POS Tagger using scikit-learn

Part-Of-Speech tagging (or POS tagging, for short) is one of the main components of almost any NLP analysis. The task of POS-tagging simply implies labelling words with their appropriate Part-Of-Speech (Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Pronoun etc).

Here, I have trained my own POS tagger by using Penn Treebank POS tagged corpus available inside NLTK. I have used  DecisionTreeClassifier in scikit-learn library to train the ML model.
